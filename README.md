This repository contains my solutions for the coursework found at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). 

The solutions for the [archived coursework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/archive) can be found in the `archived-coursework` directory.

The solutions for the newer, reworked [Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer-v9/) can be found in the `full-stack-developer` directory.
